# Sheep-Counter-RoboVitics

Using two ultrasonic sensors connected to Arduino Board, we can detect the number of sheep inside the fenced area.

The first sensor with tr1 and ech1 (trigger and echo pins respectively) detects sheeps which are entering through the gate.
The second sensor with tr2 and ech2 (trigger and echo pins respectively) detects sheeps which are leaving through the gate.
